    <p>
      Supply the Frontlines connects businesses seeking to make a difference with BC healthcare
      facilities in need for supplies and support. The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense strain on
      our healthcare system, creating resource shortages in everything from personal protective
      equipment to non-perishable food items.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that individuals and businesses in Canada can step up to help our frontline workers
      by providing key essentials to our healthcare facilities. Currently, healthcare facilities are
      in need of personal protective equipment, non-perishable food items, toiletries, and catered
      meals. Our goal is to actively connect businesses seeking to help out through donations and/or
      discounts with healthcare facilities in British Columbia.
